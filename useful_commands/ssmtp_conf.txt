/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

# The user that gets all the mails (UID < 1000, usually the admin)
root=username@gmail.com

# The mail server (where the mail is sent to), both port 465 or 587 should be acceptable
# See also https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78799
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587

# The address where the mail appears to come from for user authentication.
rewriteDomain=gmail.com

# The full hostname.  Must be correctly formed, fully qualified domain name or GMail will reject connection.
hostname=yourlocalhost.yourlocaldomain.tld

# Use SSL/TLS before starting negotiation
UseTLS=Yes
UseSTARTTLS=Yes

# Username/Password
AuthUser=username
AuthPass=password
AuthMethod=LOGIN

# Email 'From header's can override the default domain?
FromLineOverride=yes




Create aliases for local usernames (optional)

/etc/ssmtp/revaliases
root:username@gmail.com:smtp.gmail.com:587
mainuser:username@gmail.com:smtp.gmail.com:587



To test whether the Gmail server will properly forward your email:

$ echo -n 'Subject: test\n\nTesting ssmtp' | sendmail -v tousername@example.com




Change the 'From' text by editing /etc/passwd to receive mail from 'root at myhost' instead of just 'root'.

# chfn -f 'root at myhost' root
# chfn -f 'mainuser at myhost' mainuser



Which changes /etc/passwd to:

$ grep myhost /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root at myhost,,,:/root:/bin/bash
mainuser:x:1000:1000:mainuser at myhost,,,:/home/mainuser:/bin/bash



Sending email
To send email from the terminal, do:

$ echo -e "Subject: this is the subject\n\nthis is the body" | mail user@example.com
or interactively as:

$ sendmail username@example.com
Subject: this is my subject
CC: optional@example.com

Now I can type the body here




Attachments
If you need to be able to add attachments, install and configure Mutt and Msmtp and then go see the tip at nixcraft.

Alternatively, you can attach using uuencode from sharutils. To attach 'file.txt' as 'myfile.txt':

$ uuencode file.txt myfile.txt | sendmail user@example.com
